# Superstore Power BI Dashboard

### Overview
This project is a comprehensive Power BI dashboard created using the **Superstore dataset**. The dashboard covers various analysis aspects, allowing users to interact with different features of Power BI, such as visualizations, filters, and drilldowns. Additionally, it demonstrates several key **DAX functions** to showcase advanced analytical calculations in Power BI.

The primary goal of this dashboard is to help users explore Power BI's functionality by providing an interactive and intuitive experience. Users can download the `.pbix` file and get hands-on experience with Power BI and DAX queries.

### DAX Functions

This dashboard incorporates several important DAX functions to perform complex calculations. Some examples of the DAX queries used in this project are listed below:

1. **Average Profit per Quantity**:
    ```dax
    DEFINE
    MEASURE Orders[Average profit per Quantity] = 
    AVERAGEx(Orders, DIVIDE(Orders[Profit], Orders[Quantity], 0))
    ```

2. **Profit Ranking**:
    ```dax
    DEFINE
    MEASURE Orders[Sum of Profits] = SUM(Orders[Profit])
    MEASURE Orders[Profit Based Ranking] = RANKX(ALL(Orders[Sub-Category]), [Sum of Profits])
    ```

3. **Sales in 2016 Q2**:
    ```dax
    DEFINE
    MEASURE Orders[Sales in 2016 Q2] = CALCULATE(sum(Orders[Sales]), DATESBETWEEN('Calendar'[Date], DATE(2016, 4, 1), DATE(2016, 8, 30)))
    ```

4. **Sales Till Date**:
    ```dax
    DEFINE
    MEASURE Orders[Sales till date] = CALCULATE(sum(Orders[Sales]), DATESBETWEEN('Calendar'[Date], TODAY()-365, TODAY()))
    ```

5. **Month-to-Date (MTD) Sales**:
    ```dax
    DEFINE
    MEASURE Orders[MTD Sales] = TOTALMTD(SUM(Orders[Sales]), DATESMTD('Calendar'[Date]))
    ```

6. **Year-to-Date (YTD) Sales**:
    ```dax
    DEFINE
    MEASURE Orders[YTD Sales] = TOTALYTD(SUM(Orders[Sales]), DATESYTD('Calendar'[Date]))
    ```

7. **Same Period Last Year Sales**:
    ```dax
    DEFINE
    MEASURE Orders[same period last year sales] = 
    CALCULATE(
        SUM(Orders[Sales]), 
        SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Calendar'[Date])
    )
    ```

8. **Same Period Last Month Sales**:
    ```dax
    DEFINE
    MEASURE Orders[same period last month sales] = CALCULATE(sum(Orders[Sales]), PARALLELPERIOD('Calendar'[Date], -1, MONTH))
    ```
